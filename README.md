# Spending Tracker

A new Flutter application for monitoring my spending habbits. 
Using a RESTful API in Flask and a python script to parse emails.
Data is served in JSON format through a Google Virtual Machine
instance. The JSON data is then retrived by this application 
and displayed graphically.
